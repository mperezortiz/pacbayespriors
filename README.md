# Learning PAC-Bayes priors for Probabilistic Neural Networks

This repository includes the code used in the paper Learning PAC-Bayes priors for Probabilistic Neural Networks submitted to AAAI'22. Documentation of the code will be improved in subsequent versions of the repository. At the moment, the code includes a library with the functionality to run the experiments and a running example with the MNIST dataset.
